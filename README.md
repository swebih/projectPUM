Locating objects outdoors and monitoring their usage is a challenge. When it comes to hospital equipment this is an increasing necessity due to the large number of help aids that are present and used. Many help aids are lost or disappear which introduces unnecessary costs and difficulties for the hospitals. Wheelchairs, walkers and TENS-machines are objects that are lent out to patients. These objects are usually not returned to the owners due to various reasons. If these help aids are reliably monitored indoors and if the usage of these can be measured and their location tracked, they can be found. This would help more people in need. To do this type of positioning and measurement of the usage of these object, a communication with the objects is required. The communication can be done in different ways, one is using the existing wireless and mobile networks. The communication with the networks gives a broader field of application such as an alarm system. This alarm system can warn the owner if the objects are misbehaving.
